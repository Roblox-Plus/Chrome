# latest

Good morning :sweat_smile:

See what I did there? That's an emoji.. and whoa.. where are we? Welcome to [roblox.plus](https://roblox.plus/about/changes)! This is the new domain where some parts of the extension will exist going forward. At the end of last year, Roblox launched their beta OAuth2 project, and I was invited to join it. Since October 2022 I have been working every weekend to make the extension compatible with both [Roblox OAuth2](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/open-cloud/oauth2-overview), and [Google Chrome - Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). It has been... a motivation struggle, as I'm sure you've seen in the update logs, if you've been paying attention. But here are I guess. We're getting close enough to finishing up more than half a years worth of work, enough so that I'm finally ready to start sending you all to this page.

Going forward, this page is where you will get information about what has updated in the extension. This page will also be based on the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/roblox-plus/extension/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), where you can then find information about previous versions and stuffs.. assuming I populate it. I have all the data about previous versions somewhere, I promise.

## :tada: Updates

### :new: roblox.plus/about

god, I can use emojis now, this feels soooo good
yes, this is just to say that we actually have an about page now, with a bunch of information. Look on the left navigation there, click around, and read the stuffs.

okay fine, I put in absolute minimal effort into each of those tabs _except for_ the [privacy policy](https://roblox.plus/about/privacy-policy)

but whatever man

### :new: roblox.plus/settings

TODO: Fill this in with the next pull request, when there is actually settings in here

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Trade Notifier Updated

This thing has been updated to better support that manifest V3 thing I was talking about. Pretty much works the same as it did before, except you can't pick a sound for it anymore. Sorry.
