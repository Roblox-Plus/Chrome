      This page exists because it has to I guess? The terms are simple: I make{' '}
      <Link href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roblox%20/jfbnmfgkohlfclfnplnlenbalpppohkm">
        the extension
      </Link>
      , and you can use it if you want. It is only available on Chrome, and if
      you don't want to use it, you don't have to. This website exists to go
      with that extension.
      <br />I make no guarantees about anything, I promise nothing to be
      working, but for as long as it does work.. you can use it.
      <br />
      I'll make this page better someday.
    </Typography>
